Here's a clear and detailed prompt you can use for yourself, your developer, or even for me when generating the UI:

---

### üí° **Prompt: Document Update Flow ‚Äî UI Design**

**Objective:**
Design a user interface where users can:

1. View their personal and document details.
2. Navigate to view individual documents (like Aadhaar, PAN, etc.).
3. Raise a request to update any document.
4. Provide 2 other valid documents as proof during the update request.

---

### üß© **Key Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Dashboard (Landing Page)**

   * Display a card/list of each document (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, etc.)
   * For each document: show basic info like document number, issue date, and current status (e.g., Verified / Needs Update).

2. **View Document Details Page**

   * When a user clicks on a document, navigate to a detailed view.
   * Show full document data with metadata (e.g., name on document, number, address, etc.).
   * Add a "Raise Update Request" button.

3. **Raise Update Request Modal/Page**

   * User selects the field(s) to update (e.g., name, address, etc.).
   * Text input for new value(s).
   * Upload input to attach **two supporting documents** (PDF or image).
   * Optional: dropdown to select the type of each proof (e.g., PAN, Ration Card, Voter ID).
   * Submit button triggers the request and sets the document status to "Pending Verification".

4. **Admin Panel (Optional)**

   * Shows list of requests.
   * Admin can verify documents and either **Approve**, **Request Clarification**, or **Reject**.

---

### üß™ **Extra Features (Optional but Valuable):**

* Show document history or last updated timestamp.
* Visual status indicators: ‚úÖ Verified, ‚è≥ Pending, ‚ùå Rejected.
* Confirmation modal before submitting update requests.
* Notification system: show messages when updates are approved or rejected.

---

### üé® Design Notes:

* Use clean card-based layout (Tailwind CSS recommended).
* Tabs or side nav to switch between different document types.
* Use modals for update requests to avoid navigating away from main page.
* Clear error messages and upload validation.

Would you like me to generate the full HTML/React UI code for this setup next?
